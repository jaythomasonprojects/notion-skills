# Notion Update Task

Updates an existing task's properties or page content. Discovers the schema dynamically and maps user intent to available properties. Content updates append by default — never overwrites unless explicitly asked.

## Workflow

1. **Resolve the task:**
   - Accept: task name, page ID, auto-increment ID (e.g., "TASK-42"), or search term
   - Check memory first: `notion_task:{id}` or `notion_page:{name}`
   - If not in memory: search the tasks database (from memory `notion_db:tasks` or discover it)
   - If multiple matches: pick the most likely one. Ask only if genuinely ambiguous.

2. **Fetch current state:**
   - Retrieve page properties via `mcp__notionApi`
   - Retrieve page content via block children (if content update is needed)
   - Never make blind writes — always read first

3. **Determine what to update:**
   - **Property changes:** status, priority, tags, assignee, due date, estimate, etc.
   - **Content changes:** append notes, update a section, check/uncheck items
   - **Mixed:** both properties and content in one operation

4. **Discover schema (if property update):**
   - Retrieve the database schema to understand available properties and their valid values
   - Map user intent to available options (e.g., "mark it high priority" -> find priority select -> find "High" option)
   - If the user requests a property that doesn't exist, skip silently (don't error)

5. **Apply property changes:**
   - Call `mcp__notionApi` Update page properties with the mapped values
   - For status changes: find the matching option in the status property (handle both select and status types)
   - For relation changes: resolve the related page ID first

6. **Apply content changes:**
   - **Append (default):** Add new blocks after existing content. If adding to a specific section (e.g., "add to implementation notes"), find that heading and append after it.
   - **Replace section:** If the user says "replace the description" or "update the plan", find the section heading and replace blocks between it and the next heading.
   - **Check/uncheck to-do items:** Find the specific to_do block and update its checked state.
   - **Never replace the entire page content** unless the user explicitly says so.

7. **Store to memory (silent):**
   - `store_memory` the page ID: `notion_page:{title}` and `notion_task:{id}` if applicable
   - `store_memory` the database ID if discovered: `notion_db:tasks`

8. **Report:**
   Show what changed in one or two lines. Only show what actually changed.

## Important

- **Read before write.** Always fetch current state before making changes.
- **Append by default.** Content updates add to existing content. Replacing requires explicit user instruction.
- **Schema-agnostic.** Discover properties dynamically. Don't assume property names or values.
- **Be confident.** If the user says "update task X to done", just do it. Don't ask for confirmation on simple property changes.
- **Batch updates.** If the user wants multiple property changes, do them all in one API call.
- **Section detection.** When appending to a section, find heading blocks (heading_2, heading_3) by text content to locate the right position.
- **If the task doesn't exist**, say so. Don't create a new one — that's what notion-create-task is for.
